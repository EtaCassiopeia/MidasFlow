## Architecture Decision Record (ADR): MidasFlow Capabilities

### 1. Context

In today's fast-paced digital age, the need for instantaneous, efficient, and scalable data transformation tools has never been greater. MidasFlow aims to be a leader in this space, offering a suite of features that streamline the data transformation process and maximize efficiency.

### 2. Decision

The following capabilities will be integrated into the MidasFlow architecture:

#### 2.1. Dynamic API Creation

MidasFlow will allow users to swiftly generate gRPC, REST, and GraphQL APIs through minimal configuration. This promotes rapid application development and deployment.

#### 2.2. Real-time Data Transformation

Harnessing the ubiquity and familiarity of standard SQL, users can transform their data in real-time, making the data immediately actionable.

#### 2.3. Diverse Data Source Connectivity

MidasFlow will be designed to connect to a variety of data sources, encompassing:

- Google Cloud Storage

- Amazon S3

- Azure Blob Storage

- SFTP

- Local filesystem

This ensures flexibility and robustness, allowing businesses of all scales to integrate their data effortlessly.

#### 2.4. Data Source Monitoring

Beyond simple connectivity, MidasFlow will actively monitor these data sources for any changes, ensuring the system is always up-to-date and reducing the lag between data generation and data actionability.

#### 2.5. API-Driven Updates

MidasFlow will not be a one-way street. Users can push updates to their information through the API, making sure that the data landscape remains current and accurate.

#### 2.6. Caching, Searching, and Filtering

For efficiency and performance optimization, MidasFlow will cache user data. Additionally, users can leverage out-of-the-box search and filter functionalities, which enhances data retrievability and usability.

#### 2.7. Extensibility via WASM

To ensure that MidasFlow remains future-proof and adaptable, we'll incorporate support for custom connectors, operators, and API transformations through WebAssembly (WASM). This gives users the power to tailor the platform to their specific needs.

#### 2.8. Auto-Documentation

To foster clarity and ease-of-use, MidasFlow will auto-generate OpenAPI documentation and protobuf data contracts. This not only reduces manual labor but also ensures consistency and standardization.

### 3. Consequences

Implementing these features ensures:

- **Speed**: Swift API generation and real-time data transformation.

- **Flexibility**: Compatibility with multiple data sources and extensibility via WASM.

- **Efficiency**: Built-in caching, search, and filter functionalities.

- **Clarity**: Automatically generated documentation and data contracts.
