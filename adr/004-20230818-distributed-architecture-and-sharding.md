## Architecture Decision Record (ADR): Distributed Architecture & Sharding in MidasFlow for Scalability and Availability

### 1. Title

Implementing Distributed Architecture and Data Sharding for Enhanced Availability and Reduced Latency

### 2. Status

Proposed

### 3. Context

MidasFlow is expected to manage growing datasets, and maintain different versions of this data. This not only necessitates vast disk storage but also demands efficient memory management for quick data access. Ensuring low-latency responses for application requests, especially given the expected data growth and versioning overhead, poses challenges. To address these, leveraging a distributed system architecture and data sharding is essential.

### 4. Decision

#### 4.1. Distributed Architecture

- **Goal**: Distribute data across multiple nodes to ensure high availability, resilience against node failures, and efficient resource utilization.

- **Implementation**:

- Adopt a distributed system architecture that supports horizontal scaling.

- Data replication across nodes will ensure availability even if some nodes go offline.

- Implement consensus protocols to maintain data integrity and consistency across nodes.

#### 4.2. Data Sharding

- **Goal**: Distribute data across multiple storage units or servers to enhance read/write performance and manage large datasets effectively.

- **Implementation**:

- Shard data based on logical partitions (e.g., by data version, timestamp ranges, or other relevant keys) ensuring even distribution.

- Implement consistent hashing to maintain shard distribution even as new nodes are added or removed.

- Ensure that each shard has multiple replicas across the distributed nodes to provide fault tolerance.

#### 4.3. Network Partitioning & Fault Tolerance

- **Implementation**:

- Utilize a distributed system that supports the CAP theorem, particularly focusing on availability and partition tolerance (AP).

- Implement a health-check mechanism to monitor node health and re-distribute data as necessary.

- Ensure quick data recovery mechanisms in the event of node failures.

### 5. Consequences

- **Advantages**:

- Enhanced availability by distributing data across multiple nodes.

- Improved performance due to data sharding, allowing for concurrent read/writes.

- Fault tolerance against network partitioning and node failures.

- Scalable system architecture that can grow with increasing data needs.

- **Challenges**:

- Complexity in maintaining data consistency across a distributed system.

- Initial setup and maintenance overhead for distributed architecture.

- Possible latency during data re-balancing or node failures, which needs to be minimized.

- Requirement for advanced monitoring and alerting systems to track node health and performance.


This ADR lays out the strategy to adopt a distributed system architecture and implement data sharding in MidasFlow. Such design decisions aim to ensure the system's scalability, high availability, and low-latency performance in handling vast, versioned datasets. Continuous evaluation and optimization will be critical as MidasFlow scales and serves a growing number of applications.
